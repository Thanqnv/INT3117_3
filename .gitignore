# Local compiled classes output directory used by the repo

# lib/ contains third-party jars (e.g. junit-platform-console-standalone). Two common options:
# 1) Commit lib/ into the repo so tests run without extra download steps (simpler for students).
# 2) Do NOT commit jar files and instead declare dependencies via a build tool (Maven/Gradle) or
#    provide a script to download them. This keeps the repo smaller and avoids checking binaries in.
#
# Recommendation for this project: keep lib/ committed if you don't use Maven/Gradle and want
# tests to run out-of-the-box. If you plan to use a build tool, remove lib/ from the repo and
# add a rule to ignore it below.
# To ignore lib/ uncomment the following line:
# lib/
